## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://100l5.io/) - For box-shadow



### What I learned

This challenge on it's own was pretty easy but i hadn't actually touched html and css in a while to concentrate on javascript so i found myself making some silly errors here and there, especially setting the background image behind the logo, it took a while for me to finally get it to work and switch according to screen width, next time i'll try using the picture and source tagðŸ¤”



### Continued development

I'm actually learning JavaScript right now using the book: eloquent javascript, so i haven't really learned how to manipulate the DOM yet, i feel like I'm learning a lot of back end stuff though, like data structures and stuff like that, I'll probably start posting my solutions to some of the exercises in the book.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://100l5.io/) - This helped me with box-shadows. I really like how easy it was to use the site and i had time to worry about other things.
